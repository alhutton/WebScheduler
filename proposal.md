### Overall Project Description
Please include a brief description here of what your website will do overall, and how users will interact with it. Think about how you would describe your website to a friend. Ideally, also describe how your team hopes to make your website unique.  This description need not be more than 3-4 sentences.

We want to make a more useful schedule planning website for the University of Michigan. The site will include the basic function to view class data, however, we will make our site different by creating a more user-friendly interface. We want to link rate my professor so that students can decide what professor would be best for them. We also want to include rankings of difficulty for each class from past students. We also think that including the syllabus for each class will help students can get a better idea of what's going to be covered in that course. Another thing we want to make simpler is backpacking, by being able to do it right from the website so there no need for copy and pasting anymore. Lastly if possible we would like to include final grade distributions so that students can view all their class information in one place.


### Group Logistics
Your group should be meeting regularly. List here when and where your group will be holding meetings. Also, describe how your group will communicate with each other (we like GroupMe). Finally, describe how your group will divide and assign tasks among group members.

Our group currently has a group chat on GroupMe to communicate. We are planning on meeting at least twice a week on Thursday’s and Friday’s on central campus. We want to have everyone involved on every part of the project. When we meet, we will assign a main task to each group member. This person will be the main one in charge of that portion of the project and will be held accountable for it, however, some help from the rest of the group is also expected. We will also divide up the different reach aspects of the project to each person. By dividing up the work like this it will enable each member to contribute equally.
